### Lets begin by refactoring our code into modules

### I created a folder called modules
```
mkdir modules
```

Then change directory to the module directory

```
cd modules
```
### inside the module directory, I created the following files to keep our code well structured and modular
- VPC     For networking
- ALB     For Load balancer
- AS  For Autoscaling groups
- EFS   For Elastic File System
- RDS    For Database
- COMPUTE   For compute
- SECURITY For security groups
